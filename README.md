# Video Poker

This is a slightly more advanced Angular project that I've done. Using Typescript classes to control the logic for all of the game's features, you can play a simple video poker game with 1 mulligan.

You can play the game at this url: https://omnipotent42.github.io/video-poker/video-poker
